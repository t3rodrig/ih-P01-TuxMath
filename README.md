"TuxMath" is an educational game starring
Tux. Tux must defend his city by solving 
math problems.

Use the number keys on the keyboard to 
answer math equations, and then hit enter.

If you don't answer a comet's math equation 
before it crashes, Tux loses a heart.

When you lose all of your hearts, 
the game ends.
